                Poetry is white:
                it comes from water swathed in drops,
                it wrinkles and gathers,
                this planet's skin has to spread out,
                the sea's whiteness has to be ironed out,
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
            <p>
                and the hands keep moving,
                the sacred surfaces get smoothed,
                and things are done this way:
                the hands make the world every day,
                fire conjoins with steel,
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="three">
            <p>
                linen, canvas, and cotton arrive
                from the scuffles in the laundries,
                and from light a dove is born:
                chastity returns out of the foam. 
            </p>
